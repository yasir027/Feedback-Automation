# Filtering Good Reviews Only

This project is a simple webpage that allows users to rate their experience using a 5-emoji rating system. Based on the user's selected rating, the page either shows feedback or redirects them to Google reviews.

## Features
- **5 Emoji Rating System**: The webpage presents 5 emojis, each representing a different level of satisfaction, ranging from a poor review to a great one.
- **Conditional Redirect**: When a user selects the 4th or 5th emoji (indicating a good review), the page redirects them to Google Reviews for further feedback.
- **Responsive and Interactive**: The page is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple interface and responsive layout.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the webpage to create a clean, modern look and feel.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, including handling the emoji selection and the conditional redirect.

## How It Works
1. **User Selection**: The page displays five emojis for users to choose from. Each emoji represents a different level of satisfaction (1 being the worst and 5 being the best).
2. **Redirect Logic**: 
   - If the user selects the 4th or 5th emoji, they will be redirected to Google Reviews for more detailed feedback.
   - Any selection less than the 4th emoji will not trigger a redirect.
3. **Simple Interface**: The page is easy to navigate, with clear instructions on how to rate.
